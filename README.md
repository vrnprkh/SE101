# Overview

The goal of this project was to design an interactive chessboard that track moves and acts as a teaching tool for beginners.
Each piece would have a magnet underneath which then could be detected using a 
4x4 grid of halls sensors to track where the piece was on the board.
In software, the changes in the sensor data was processed and then tracked.

This project was a first year design project for the course SE101.

Group members: Emily Wang, Justin Lin, Jacqueline Ho, Nandan Patel, Varun Parikh.
